# DMDB (the *Dunder Mifflin* Database)

This entry won't be as serious or instructional as other entries may be - this is just a bit of fun that I had at university that I would like to share. My team and I worked on this during the first semester of our third year, and it was a blast trying to fit the world of NBC's *The Office* into a system that makes sense. The show gives a lot of attention to detail to the company, usually used as a foil against characters, but this allowed us to extract some important information about *Dunder Mifflin* as a whole.
